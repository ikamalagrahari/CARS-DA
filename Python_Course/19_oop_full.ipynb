Inheritance**\n","Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where one class (**child class**) inherits the attributes and methods of another class (**parent class**). It allows code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n","\n","#### **Key Points:**\n","- The child class can use or override the parent class's properties and methods.\n","- Supports **code reusability**.\n","\n","#### **Syntax:**\n","```python\n","class ParentClass:\n","    def parent_method(self):\n","        print(\"This is a method in the parent class.\")\n","\n","class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n","    def child_method(self):\n","        print(\"This is a method in the child class.\")\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"This is an animal speaking.\")\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):  # Dog class inherits from Animal\n","    def bark(self):\n","        print(\"Woof!\")\n","\n","# Using inheritance\n","dog = Dog()\n","dog.speak()  # Inherited method from Animal\n","dog.bark()   # Method defined in Dog\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","This is an animal speaking.\n","Woof!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Abstraction**\n","Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it.\n","\n","#### **Key Points:**\n","- Achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.\n","- Abstract methods must be implemented in child classes.\n","\n","#### **Syntax:**\n","In Python, abstraction is achieved using the `abc` module.\n","\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","class AbstractClass(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def abstract_method(self):\n","        pass  # Must be implemented in the child class\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def make_sound(self):\n","        pass\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def make_sound(self):\n","        print(\"Woof!\")\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    def make_sound(self):\n","        print(\"Meow!\")\n","\n","# Abstract class cannot be instantiated\n","dog = Dog()\n","cat = Cat()\n","dog.make_sound()  # Output: Woof!\n","cat.make_sound()  # Output: Meow!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Polymorphism**\n","Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows the same method to behave differently based on the object that calls it.\n","\n","#### **Key Points:**\n","- Achieved through **method overriding** or **operator overloading**.\n","- Promotes **flexibility** and **extensibility**.\n","\n","#### **Example: Method Overriding**\n","```python\n","class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"This animal makes a sound.\")\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Woof!\")\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Meow!\")\n","\n","# Polymorphism in action\n","def animal_sound(animal):\n","    animal.speak()\n","\n","dog = Dog()\n","cat = Cat()\n","\n","animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!\n","animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Encapsulation**\n","Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved using **access modifiers** (`public`, `protected`, `private`).\n","\n","#### **Key Points:**\n","- Protects data by controlling access using access modifiers:\n","  - **Public:** Accessible anywhere.\n","  - **Protected (_variable):** Accessible within the class and subclasses.\n","  - **Private (__variable):** Accessible only within the class.\n","- Provides controlled access using **getter** and **setter** methods.\n","\n","#### **Syntax:**\n","```python\n","class ClassName:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.public_var = \"I am public\"\n","        self._protected_var = \"I am protected\"\n","        self.__private_var = \"I am private\"\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","class Person:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name         #
